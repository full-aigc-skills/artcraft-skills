# ArtCraft native brand token mixed workflow architecture

## 1. Authority and versions

OpenSpec AC-SK-003-BRAND and task 3.17 govern this addition. Source release candidate dev.20 pins VectorCraft skills dev.6. The ArtCraft orchestration runtime remains dev.16 and VectorCraft native CLI remains 0.2.0. Public scripts and payload schemas remain compatible. The upstream desktop application is research material, not this runtime's command authority.

## 2. Installation and execution

Each of ten independent skills contains its own example, guide, installer and locked distribution manifest. The published VectorCraft skills archive is rebuilt from immutable source tag v0.1.0-dev.6, SHA-bound at archive and file level. No sibling skill or plugin-private path is required. Existing immutable cache entries remain separate from the new version.

```

## 3. Native revision and dependencies

The revised logo references its original artifact and independently supplied native project SHA, opens that project and edits the registered global RGB swatch. Its original export inventory is inherited only after digest verification. The explicit DAG changes consumers' input fingerprints, so poster, intro and film produce new native deliverables. The independent badge task is reused. Prior projects, output bytes and supplied audio remain unchanged. Identical revision replay reuses verified tasks and budget.

Consumers in this example are generated from their prior plans. Preserving additional hand edits inside a consumer requires registering that consumer's source project and a supported domain-local edit. This example does not imply those unregistered edits survive regeneration.

## 4. Verification and packaging

The old locked skill bundle fails the native logo step and blocks its consumers while the independent badge succeeds. With dev.6, a single copied ArtCraft revise skill and fresh public runtime cache pass in 48.357 seconds. Checks bind installed VectorCraft version, changed four outputs and decoded poster/intro/film pixels, byte-identical independent logo icon, all prior files, original audio, repeat task identity/budget and five verified packaged child projects.

Default regression: 57 tests, 46 pass and 11 native/offline gated skips, 5.550 seconds. Bounded cold native testing is separate from this regression. Publication and fixed-release installed-host acceptance remain pending. Evidence: docs/evidence/brand-token-mixed-first-use.json.

## 5. Boundaries

RGB native global swatches and explicit registered DAG consumers are covered. Automatic model design, undeclared cross-file dependency discovery, other color models, cross-editor editable token preservation, GUI, speech quality and human creative acceptance are not claimed. The synthetic test audio is an input fixture, not narrated speech. review_ready means pending review, not acceptance.
